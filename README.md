merge-and-convert-files


As an Administrative clerk

I would like an automation utility (e.g. simple console app) that combines the contents from a list of PDF files into a single PDF file

So that I can aggregate the results to a simple single file (e.g. send a single file to a distribution list and not be concerned with spamming its recipients)


Acceptance Criteria:

An input list of PDFs can be selected (command line arguments are perfectly acceptable)

An output file is provided (command line argument acceptable here as well)

The contents of the source files are stored in PDF format into the output file


Notes:

Implement in a language of your choice

Structure and respective components are favored over a full functioning implementation (simple print statements to stdout are more than sufficient to express the design)

Things to be aware of:

Application of principles of SOLID

Testability of units/components


Extra Credit:

Consider how you might go about making it extensible to other input/output types (e.g. txt to pdf, pdf to txt, txt to html, pdf to csv)
